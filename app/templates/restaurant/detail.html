    <p>We are for a more resilient food production and consumption system, which preserves and restores natural ecosystems. We are searching for products which are produced without polluting or degrading the environment. Food which is not in competition with precious ecosystems. We want to demonstrate that ecologically sustainable agriculture can feed the world without damaging the natural environment or threatening human health. We take action to make sure our products are as sustainable, local and nutritious as possible.</p>
    <p>Besides safeguarding that our products are from sustainable sources, we try to completely close the cycle and also ensure that the eventual destination of our food is sustainable.</p>
    <p>We are on our way to a zero-waste kitchen and recycle as much as possible. Read more about our Greenhouse, the Biogasboat, and our urinal which produces struvite.</p>
